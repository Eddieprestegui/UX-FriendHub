# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

FriendsHub is a location-sharing platform designed to facilitate a more detailed and controlled sharing of location information among family, friends, and acquaintances. This report outlines the research methods used to understand user needs, competitor landscape, and initial designs for the location-sharing features of FriendsHub.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!! During our research for our competitive analysis we diagnosed two main competitors: Snapchat & Life360. The main weakness that we discovered within SnapChat is that a lot of users interact with bots and unneccessary content. A weakness with Life360 is that users can't customize the location radius with other users, so if a user doesn't want to share their exact location with another user, it's not possible.     

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
